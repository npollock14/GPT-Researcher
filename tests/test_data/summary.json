            "content": "American building company\nTaylor Morrison is one of the largest home building companies in the United States. Its corporate headquarters are in Scottsdale, Arizona. The company formed when Taylor Woodrow and Morrison Homes joined forces in July 2007. Taylor Morrison operates in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Nevada, and Texas, building mid-to-upscale housing, as well as first-time and mid-market homes.\nHistory [ edit ]\nTaylor Woodrow was founded in 1921 by Frank Taylor and Jack Woodrow. They built a pair of modest semi-detached houses at 347 and 349 Central Drive, Blackpool in England. During the 1920s, Lord Taylor\u2019s new company concentrated on providing low- cost, high quality housing in the Lancashire area. In the 1930s, Taylor Woodrow diversified into building temporary hospitals, etc., and thereby moved into general construction. In 1936 Taylor Woodrow entered the Canadian construction market through the acquisition of Monarch Development Corporation, founded in 1917, one of Canada\u2019s oldest, largest and most diversified real estate companies. In 1953 the company purchased a controlling interest in a newly established business, Monarch Mortgage and Investments Limited, which owned land, apartment complexes, stores, and houses in the Toronto area, and in 1994, entered into the high-rise sector. Between 1945 and 2001 Taylor Woodrow's main operations were in general construction with Taylor Woodrow Homes only being a small part of the Group.\nMorrison Homes was initially founded in Seattle in 1905 by C.G. Morrison and moved to northern California in 1946. The company built primarily first-time and midmarket home communities in Phoenix, Sacramento, Denver, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa, Austin, and Houston. George Wimpey Plc acquired Morrison Homes in 1984 when it was based in San Francisco. George Wimpey's 2001 acquisition of Richardson Homes was later integrated under the Morrison brand.\nOn July 6, 2007, the United Kingdom-based parent companies of Morrison Homes Inc. and Taylor Woodrow Inc. joined. Taylor Woodrow Plc. and George Wimpey Plc. formed a new company, Taylor Wimpey Plc., becoming one of the world's largest home building companies. Morrison Homes joined with Taylor Woodrow as part of the parent company formation.\nThe companies continued to operate under their existing brands until 2008, when they began to operate under the new Taylor Morrison brand.\nIn July, 2011, Taylor Morrison became a wholly owned subsidiary of TMM Holdings Limited Partnership, which is indirectly owned by investment funds separately managed by TPG Capital, Oaktree Capital Management, as well as JH Investments. It was taken public in 2013.[2]\nBibliography [ edit ]\nJenkins, Alan (1971). On Site 1921-71 . Heinemann:London. pp. 226p. ISBN 0-434-90890-8 .\nJenkins, Alan (1980).

generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we provide our investors with supplemental information relating to: (i) adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share, (ii) adjusted income before income taxes and related margin, (iii) adjusted home closings gross margin; (iv) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and (v) net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted income before income taxes and related margin are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect the net income/(loss) available to the Company excluding, to the extent applicable in a given period, the impact of inventory impairment charges, impairment of investment in unconsolidated entities, pre-acquisition abandonment charges, gains/losses on land transfers and extinguishment of debt, net, and in the case of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share, the tax impact due to such items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that measure performance by adjusting net income before allocation to non-controlling interests to exclude, as applicable, interest expense/(income), net, amortization of capitalized interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), non-cash compensation expense, if any, inventory impairment charges, impairment of investment in unconsolidated entities, pre-acquisition abandonment charges, gains/losses on land transfers and extinguishment of debt, net. Net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure we calculate by dividing (i) total debt, plus unamortized debt issuance cost/(premium), net, and less mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (\"net homebuilding debt\"),, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity). Adjusted home closings gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure based on GAAP home closings gross margin (which is inclusive of capitalized interest), excluding inventory impairment charges.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis, as well as the performance of our regions, and to set targets for performance-based compensation. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. In the future, we may include additional adjustments in the above-described non-GAAP financial measures to the extent we deem them appropriate and useful to management and investors.\nWe believe that adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share, adjusted income before income taxes and related margin, as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, are useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because such metrics assist both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Adjusted EBITDA also provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, or unusual items. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. We believe that adjusted home closings gross margin is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the varying effects of items or transactions we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures of our operating performance or liquidity. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry may report similar information, their definitions may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures before comparing their measures to ours.\nA reconciliation of (i) adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share, (ii) adjusted income before income taxes and related margin, (iii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and (iv) net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio to the comparable GAAP measures is presented below. Because the company did not experience any material adjustments applicable to adjusted home closings gross margin during the periods presented that would cause such measure to differ from the comparable GAAP measure such measure has not been separately presented herein.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Common Share\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n2023\n2022\nNet income available to TMHC\n$ 234,602\n$ 290,987\nGain on land transfers\n\u2014\n(13,700)\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net\n\u2014\n(13,471)\nTax impact due to above non-GAAP reconciling items\n\u2014\n6,749\nAdjusted net income\n$ 234,602\n$ 270,565\nBasic weighted average number of shares\n109,210\n117,932\nAdjusted earnings per common share - Basic\n$ 2.15\n$ 2.29\nDiluted weighted average number of shares\n110,856\n118,931\nAdjusted earnings per common share - Diluted\n$ 2.12\n$ 2.27\nAdjusted Income Before Income Taxes and Related Margin\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2023\n2022\nIncome before income taxes\n$ 315,759\n$ 391,597\nGain on land transfers\n\u2014\n(13,700)\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net\n\u2014\n(13,471)\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n$ 315,759\n$ 364,426\nTotal revenue\n$ 2,060,564\n$ 1,995,023\nIncome before income taxes margin\n15.3 %\n19.6 % Adjusted income before income taxes margin\n15.3 %\n18.3 %\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2023\n2022\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n$ 234,905\n$ 293,154\nInterest (income)/expense, net\n(5,120)\n5,189\nAmortization of capitalized interest\n37,352\n33,420\nIncome tax provision\n80,854\n98,443\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,540\n1,442\nEBITDA\n$ 349,531\n$ 431,648\nNon-cash compensation expense\n5,271\n5,278\nGain on land transfers\n\u2014\n(13,700)\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net\n\u2014\n(13,471)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 354,802\n$ 409,755\nTotal revenue\n$ 2,060,564\n$ 1,995,023\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests as a percentage of\ntotal revenue\n11.4 %\n14.7 % EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue\n17.0 %\n21.6 % Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue\n17.2 %\n20.5 %\nDebt to Capitalization Ratios Reconciliation\n($ in thousands)\nAs of\nJune 30, 2023\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2023\nAs of\nJune 30, 2022\nTotal debt\n$ 2,393,571\n$ 2,301,878\n$ 2,950,744\nPlus: unamortized debt issuance cost, net\n9,613\n10,193\n11,891\nLess: mortgage warehouse borrowings\n$ (249,898)\n(146,334)\n(179,555)\nTotal homebuilding debt\n$ 2,153,286\n$ 2,165,737\n$ 2,783,080\nTotal equity\n5,095,313\n4,846,546\n4,193,895\nTotal capitalization\n$ 7,248,599\n$ 7,012,283\n$ 6,976,975\nTotal homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio\n29.7 %\n30.9 %\n39.9 % Total homebuilding debt\n$ 2,153,286\n$ 2,165,737\n$ 2,783,080\nLess: cash and cash equivalents\n(1,227,264)\n(877,717)\n(378,340)\nNet homebuilding debt\n$ 926,022\n$ 1,288,020\n$ 2,404,740\nTotal equity\n5,095,313\n4,846,546\n4,193,895\nTotal capitalization\n$ 6,021,335\n$ 6,134,566\n$ 6,598,635\nNet homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio\n15.4 %\n21.0 %\n36.4 %\nCONTACT:\nMackenzie Aron, VP Investor Relations\n(480) 734-2060\ninvestor@taylormorrison.com\nSOURCE Taylor Morrison",
